<p> A long-time resident in the greater Seattle area, Michael holds 20+ years of residential architect design, and real-estate investment. 
 Michael's business strives on client satisfaction and referrals.
 
<p> Purchasing your first home is exciting, but can also be intimidating. It might be your biggest (or the first) investment in life. 
 Rest assured that Michael
will educate you step by step, understand how various mortgage programs work, do comp and practice making offers. It takes a patient realtor to walk with you throughout the whole process, 
 however long that takes, until you find your dream home.
